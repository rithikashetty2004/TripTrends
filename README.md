# TripTrends
This project delivers a comprehensive, end-to-end exploration of Uber ride data, combining Python-based data analysis with interactive visualizations in Power BI.  Through this work, we analyze ride behavior, trip patterns, and user trends using Jupyter Notebook and showcase insights through a Power BI dashboard.

## Machine Learning Components

Within the notebook, the following models and techniques are applied:

- **Trip Type Prediction**: A classification model to identify whether a ride is for **Business** or **Personal** use.
- **Distance vs Duration**: Implemented **Simple Linear Regression** to understand relationships between miles traveled and trip duration.
- Used `train_test_split`, `accuracy_score`, and `classification_report` from `scikit-learn` for evaluation.
